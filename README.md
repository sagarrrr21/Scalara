# Scalara

 What This Platform Does
Imagine a tool that takes your code and turns it into a live website—automatically. That’s what your platform does. It’s built to help developers go from writing code to sharing it with the world, without worrying about servers, configurations, or deployment headaches.
You connect your GitHub project, and the system takes care of everything:
- It grabs your code.
- Builds it into something browsers can understand (HTML, CSS, JS).
- Hosts it online so anyone can visit your site instantly.
Whether you’re working with React, plain HTML, or any modern web framework, this platform makes deployment fast, simple, and scalable.

 How It Works
- Upload Service: You give it a GitHub link, and it pulls your code into cloud storage.
- Deployment Service: It builds your project, turning it into static files ready for the web.
- Request Handler: It serves your site to users around the world, using caching to keep things fast.

 Why It’s Useful
Most developers just want to write code and see it live. This platform removes the technical barriers:
- No need to set up servers.
- No manual deployments.
- No complex build pipelines.
It’s perfect for solo developers, teams, or anyone who wants to ship fast and scale effortlessly.

 Bonus Features You Can Add
- Custom domains
- Environment variables
- Preview deployments for every Git branch
- Rollbacks to previous versions
- Team collaboration tools
